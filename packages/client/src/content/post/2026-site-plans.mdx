I just finished reading [A website to destroy all websites](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/) (if you haven't already you really should), and I'm inspired to put a breath of fresh air into this website which I call home. I've always believed in the importance of having a personal site, and while I have added my own small pieces of flair, I think there's a lot more I can do to help put myself on the page. Currently my website is utilitarian, built to deliver information in a clean way. While I do enjoy the minimal and clean aesthetic, a lot of my own personality gets washed out. Not sure what the changes look like yet, but they will come, and I will have fun :) 

Some other things I'm looking to add / change:
- Look into webmentions
- Create a ["now page"](https://nownownow.com/about)
- Move my [bear blog](https://bearblog.stevedylan.dev) style content to something like `/updates`

While something like a personal site is small and probably doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of the internet, it does matter to me. I've spent plenty of time beating the point that the web is what you make of it and how you engage it. A few months ago I dumped most of my social media accounts and my mental state has improved significantly. Writing regularly on this blog and my bear blog have introduced me to so many wonderful people via [email](mailto:contact@stevedylan.dev) that I now keep up with via RSS. I've taken small explorations into [Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net) and even have an iOS client in the works just for my own fun. 

Whether its HTML, CSS, or just plain text, _you_ can build, create, express, and share with real people. It doesn't have to be mind numbing feeds that get you riled up over pointless issues, or a bunch of really crappy AI slop videos. The internet can be wonderful, and it starts with us.

Make a personal website, make a blog, and if you have questions or have no idea where to start, I'm totally willing to [help](mailto:contact@stevedylan.dev). My time and my talents are small, but I firmly believe the we can make something great.

See you around the web 🏄
