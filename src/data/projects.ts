			"Over the years I've noticed how so many decentralized applications on EVM chains have slowly built up heavy dependency trees. With some of the supplychain hacks occurring on NPM, I decided it would be a good idea to build atomic web components that achieve all the basic functionality needed to build dApps. The result was norns, which is a library + CLI for simple EVM UI components. Much like shadcn/ui you can import the raw code to your framework or vanilla HTML file and they won't ever break since they have zero dependencies or base framework; just JavaScript.",

			"I stopped using Next.js and Vercel a while ago due to the amount of vendor lock-in the stack introduced. As an alternative I started using a combination of a Vite + React frontend with a Hono backend. I was setting up separate repos so many times I decided to turn it into a monorepo using Bun. bhvr is a simple barebones template that helps people setup their own project with the same stack, featuring a shared package folder for types that can be used in both server and client. More importantly, each piece can easily be pulled out from one hosting provider and used in another, making it portable and independent.",

It also brought about a new theme under the same name, which has been ported to Neovim and Zed if you're interested.",

Instead of using a slower solution like IPNS to point to new content, IPCM is a smart contract that is used as the source of truth for a piece of dynamic content. It features a simple state that can only be updated by the owner of the contract but read by anyone, as well as a public version history through Solidity events.",

		description:
			"A Farcaster Mini App that merges the GitHub event feed into the Farcaster social graph. Warpcast created an API that exposed the GitHub verifications made by all users and I thought it would be fun to see a feed GitHub events for all the people I follow that have the verification. Only problem was the number was in the 40K+ range which was too many to filter through. To solve this I built a fairly complex backend that indexes for each user that wants to see their feed and stores the users who have the verifications as well as their events. This was a great exercise in optimizing data pipelines and uses a mix of Cloudflare workers, KVs, D1 database, and queues.",

Signers are ED25519 keypair that are signed by the primary wallet of a user, and they operate like API keys that can be revoked down the road. They are crucial to the Farcaster ecosystem as they allow users to 'sign-in' to other Farcaster apps and interact with the protocol. This small web app makes it easy to generate a signer for your account, but the code is also FOSS as an educational tool for new Farcaster devs.",
