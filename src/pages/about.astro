    <p>
      Hey there! My name is Steve and I’m a DX Engineer with a passion for
      developer tooling that advances cypherpunk values, such as privacy,
      decentralization, and self-sovereignty. I’m currently working at
      <a
        class="style-link inline-block"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        aria-label="namehash"
        href="https://namehash.io"
      >
        NameHash Labs</a
      >
      where I'm helping build tools for ENS and improve the developer experience as
      much as possible. I'm also working on a host of other <a
        class="style-link inline-block"
        aria-label="projects"
        href="/projects">projects</a
      >, the latest being
      <a
        target="_blank"

        href={projects[0].link}
      >
        {projects[0].title}
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My greatest desire is to help build technologies that empower people who
      would otherwise be powerless, whether it's financial systems, information
      privacy, or democratizing software.
